## What Gets Deleted

The API automatically deletes all related records for the specified date **ONLY for the user's branch**:
- All shifts with 'day-close' status (branch-specific)
- All DayClose records (branch-specific)
- All DaySales records (branch-specific)

## Security Features

1. **Branch Isolation:** Users can ONLY delete reports from their own branch
2. **Admin Authentication:** Only admin users can perform delete operations
3. **Branch ID Required:** API will fail if no branch ID is provided
4. **Complete Cleanup:** Removes all related data for the date and branch only

## Notes

- Deletes everything for the specified date
- Works for both shift-wise and whole-day scenarios
- Deleted records cannot be recovered, so use with caution
